				<h2>From Immigrant to Developer</h2>
				<p>
					I arrived in the U.S. at age 10 with my sister, speaking no English.
					After settling in the California Bay Area, I graduated from De Anza
					High School and embarked on a two-year Spanish-speaking mission that
					shaped my core values of empathy, perseverance, and collaboration.

				<h2>Leadership Through Service</h2>
				<p>
					My career in food service taught me invaluable lessons about
					leadership and business operations. Starting as a Pizza Hut delivery
					driver, I quickly advanced to General Manager, eventually overseeing
					five different stores across Utah for both Pizza Hut and Domino's.
					Managing teams through rapid growth and the COVID-19 pandemic honed my
					ability to adapt, lead under pressure, and maintain high
					standards—skills that translate perfectly to software development.

				<h2>The Tech Transition</h2>
				<p>
					In 2021, I took the leap into web development through Dev Mountain's
					full-stack bootcamp. What started as a long-held interest became my
					passion. I love crafting solutions with React.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL,
					JavaScript, and TypeScript, bringing the same dedication to code
					quality that I brought to restaurant operations.

				<h2>Beyond Code</h2>
				<p>
					When I'm not building applications, you'll find me watching movies,
					gaming, reading manga, or contributing to community projects through
					my church. Most importantly, this journey led me to my wonderful
					wife—proving that sometimes the best things come from unexpected
					career paths.
