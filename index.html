  <summary>My Story</summary>
  <p>
  <br>
  My family emigrated to the United States when I was 10 years old. My sister and I arrived at the JFK Airport in February of 2000 with no knowledge of the language or the culture. Soon after we moved around the country until we settled in the California Bay Area. It was there that I spend my formative years, graduating from De Anza High School in Richmond, CA.
  </br>
  <br>Soon after graduating I left on a two-year full time proselyting mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, Spanish speaking. It was there that I developed many of the positive attributes I possess today and matured into my own person. I learned the founding principles which I base my life including how to work with others, how to empathize with those who are different than me, and how to work hard in the face of rejection and adversity.
</br>
  <br>After those two years I returned home where I attended American River Community College in Sacramento, Ca. Nevertheless, after just a year I felt the need to move to the state of Utah where I started my long-time career in the food service industry. It began at Pizza Hut as a delivery driver, and as I grew into the role and enjoyed my time with the company, I became a shift manager and eventually a General Manager where I had the opportunity to manage two different stores, in Payson and American Fork, UT. I left that company in 2016 and joined Dominoâ€™s ever-growing organization. There I would also go on to promote to General Manager and personally manage three stores, in Roy, South Jordan and Highland, UT. It was in these roles that I was able to develop my leadership skills as well as my business administration skills as I oversaw hiring, training, and the day-to-day operations of the store. This was a challenging task in trying to execute company standards, keep up with ever growing sales demands as well as deal with the drastic and never-before seen challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, I am grateful for those opportunities which provided me rapid growth as a leader, and it is where I met my wonderful wife.</br>
  <br> At the beginning of 2021 I joined the Dev Mountain bootcamp course for full stack Web Development. My interest in the field had always been present but until then I did not have the opportunity to pursue the knowledge required to transition into that field. I enjoy front as well as back-end development, including working with Reactjs, PostgresQL, Nodejs, Javascript, Typescript and many of the other facets of the industry. My hobbies include watching movies, playing video games, writing, reading manga and serving my community through church related activities and projects.</br>
