# üöÄ GitHub Webhook Auto-Deployment ‚Äî Carlos‚Äôs Setup

This repository is connected to a custom GitHub webhook that triggers automatic deployments to a live server using a secure shell script. This document outlines the architecture, issues encountered during setup, and the implemented solutions.

## üì¶ Deployment Workflow Overview

1. A commit is pushed to the `main` branch on GitHub.
2. GitHub triggers a webhook pointing to:

3. `deploy.php` executes `pull-carlos.sh` via `shell_exec()`.
4. The bash script securely connects via SSH using a deploy key, fetches new commits, resets the live code, and logs the deployment.
